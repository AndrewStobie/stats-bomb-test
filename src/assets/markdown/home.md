# Welcome to Stats-Bob-Omb

Hello, and welcome to the stats-bob-omb sample site!

There are many lessons I learned and things I would have like to have done or done differently. I tried many different technologies with graphql, prism, json backends. Node backends, netlify. different fornt end frameworks like Remix (which was pretty cool), and other things. Ultimately, I went with React, netlfiy lambdas, and supabase with postgresql for my stack. I tried a few things out this funky colour scheme. I added light and dark modes.
